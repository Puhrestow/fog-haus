        Business is changing.
        Sustainability and social
        innovation are at the
        forefront, and the era of
        conglomerates is rapidly dying.

      p.bodyCopy.
        At Fog, we realize the new consumer is more demanding and savvier than
        big marketing companies will allude to. They want products with impact,
        are forward thinking and culturally-relevant; we bridge that gap.

          And we know that the demand will continue to grow. Why? We’re just like
          you. We’re consumers and we’re business owners. We support social and
          societal products and we build them too. We’ve helped companies and
          cool individuals launch, grow and generate revenue while empowering
          their users to live and lead better lives.

        p.bodyCopy.bodyCopy--small.bodyCopy--altColor.
          We started Fog to continue the practice of building more of those.

        p.bodyCopy.bodyCopy--small.bodyCopy--altColor.
          Here’s how we do it.

          p.bodyCopy.bodyCopy--small.bodyCopy--altColor.
            Need an investor or applying for an accelerator to push & fund your
            idea? We help you visualize your idea into a tangible design that
            refines your concept, establishes business need, wireframes and art
            direction.

            You’ve said to yourself, “This is it! I’ve got the idea that will
            radically change ____” hold it right there. Before you spend an
            exorbitant fee on getting your idea developed - think about the risk
            involved. Don’t do that. Instead, partnering with us reduces your
            initial risk by taking equity and sharing the burden of launching
            a successful project with you. Best of all, you get a co-founder packed
            with nearly a decade of startup expertise.

            “I need a website”, “I need branding”, “I need an app…” we’ve heard
            them all and we know how to help you. This is where we ask you a ton of
            questions, figure out your goals, define the scope, develop & refine
            a concept, design the hell out of it, and deploy it. You will be happy,
            and your users will thank you. You’re welcome.
